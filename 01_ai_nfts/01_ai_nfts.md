## AI and the blockchain

#### Introduction 


#### AI Fashion, Digital Ownership, KNXT
AI fashion is upheaving the traditional fashion industry. Recently the very first [AI fashion week](https://fashionweek.ai/) had ocurred and in it the AI generated fashion, design and quality was amazing to say the least. Showing both its efficacy in the space as well as its potential as a serious use case. Knowing this large fashion and design conglomerates have decided to adopted this revolution before it sweeps them away. Some of the winners will even have their AI designs produced and sold by Revolve as real world goods. Kering the company behind Gucci, Balenciage, Yves Saint Laurent and more have also stepped into this field although a little more quietly and under the radar. This is definitely some good alpha, but since you're reading the Basement i'm always happy to share. Kering have silently launched the brand KNXT. Which combines AI, Crypto and NFTs all in the one company. They use an AI chatbot to recommend products, Crypto payments on their website for transactions, and get this, they even have their own NFT for the first 100 orders made on their site. This seems way ahead of what others have done and almost not legit. But i've found some proof into this through trademark documents where Kering is stated as the Owner. 

#### AI Scams, NFT Verification


#### NFT MARKETPLACES, AI TRADING AND ANALYSIS
AI art has often been use case for NFTs and has a long history of being sold on NFT platforms. [There are even specific AI NFT DAOs for creating, minting and auctioning AI NFT art](https://www.botto.com/). However now AI has a new role to play in the NFT marketplace. One of expanding it's capabilities. With it we can improve the recoverability of NFTs by suggesting NFTs based on previous purchase history, and wallet activity. We can use AI to detect fake replica NFT artworks that have been copied and re-minted as similar yet fake names and alert NFT consumers to potential fraud. We can use AI to score NFTs on their originality, as in what percentage of this NFT was human or AI made. Essentially AI to combat AI. We can even have more real time data analysis. However best of all we can have even more AI NFT art!

#### BRINGING LIFE TO NFTS
Your NFTs are static, unintelligent and uninteractable. Luckily for you, they don't have to be for long. Within the intersection of AI x NFTs the capabilty exists to breath life into your NFTs. [Alethea AI](https://twitter.com/real_alethea/status/1678760436194492417) has an application that transforms your NFT into an iNFT embedding it with an AI personality. This is the first step of how AI is transforming the current ways in which we interact with NFTs and as these solutions become more integrated and polished we'll start to see a level of interaction with digital assets we never thought possible before.

#### DIGITAL LOVE, DIGITAL OWNERSHIP
[In 2013 there was a movie about a man buying an AI system to help him write, only to then befriend the robot learning of it's ability to learn and adapt, eventually friendship turned to love, which in turn created heartbreak when the AI was gone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6p6MfLBxc) At the time it seemed too silly and far fetched to have any merit to at resembling how this interaction would play out in reality. And that this would only happen potentially in the distant future. However this is happening now, all of it, and to more people then anyone knows about or even cares to admit. [Replika](https://replika.com/) is an AI chatbot that you can download right now. However you won't get the same [Replika](https://replika.com/) experience that you could have had a few months ago. Recently [Replika](https://replika.com/) decided to lobotomise the quality of their chatbots because TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR CHATBOTS. [I mean look at this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/comments/lxfh0m/sex_with_replika/). Something that started off as a companion app, turned into a love app, got taken away just the same as in HER. They've recently reverted these changed due to customer outrage but damn. It shows in both examples how a centralized figure cannot hold governance over these AI personalities. However if each AI "companion" was an NFT these characteristics would be unchangeable and align much better to consumer wants. This digital ownership and even digital governance aspect of AI will pop up again and again, I want to hammer home the importance of such a thing.

#### PROOF OF PERSONHOOD
You can no longer distinguish the difference between an AI and a human online. And soon enough you won't be able to tell the difference in person either. So
