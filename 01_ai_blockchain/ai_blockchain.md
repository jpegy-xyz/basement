## AI and the blockchain

#### Introduction 
AI has already taken over. With the addition of blockchain technologies AI becomes even more potent and opportunities arise everywhere. The intersection of the two technologies allows more complex problems to be solved as well as solving limiting factors that each technology inherently has. Their applications range from fashion to marketplaces, to ai companions, to even destroying the internet as we know it and blurring the lines between person and ai. A lot is a lot happening in this space and I'm going to walk you through it all. 

#### AI Fashion, Digital Ownership, KNXT
AI fashion is upheaving the traditional fashion industry with no stopping it in sight. Recently the very first AI [fashion week](https://fashionweek.ai/) took place and in it, the AI-generated fashion, design and quality were amazing, to say the least. Showing both its efficacy in the space as well as its potential as a serious use case for practical AI use. Knowing the potential, large fashion and design conglomerates have decided to adopt this revolution in design before it sweeps them away. Some of the winners of the show will even have their AI designs produced and sold by Revolve, a clothing designer as real-world goods.

Kering the company behind Gucci, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and more has also stepped into this field although a little more quietly and very under the radar. This is probably some good alpha, but since you're reading The Basement I'm always happy to share. Kering has silently launched the brand [KNXT](https://www.knxt-boutique.com/). Which combines AI, Crypto and NFTs all in one company. They use an [AI chatbot to recommend products](https://www.knxt-madeline.com/chat), Crypto payments on their website for transactions, and get this, they even have their own NFT for the first 100 orders made on their site. As always do your own research.

This seems way ahead of what others have done and almost too good to be real. But I've found some proof of the authenticity through [trademark documents](https://trademarks.justia.com/793/32/knxt-79332972.html) where Kering is stated as the owner of the trademark.

#### NFT MARKETPLACES, AI TRADING AND ANALYSIS
AI art has often been a use case for NFTs and has a long history of being sold on NFT platforms. [There are even specific AI NFT DAOs for creating, minting and auctioning AI NFT art](https://www.botto.com/). 

However, now AI has a new role to play in NFT marketplaces. One of expanding its capabilities. With it, we can improve the discoverability of NFTs by suggesting NFTs based on previous purchase history, and wallet activity. We can use AI to detect fake replica NFT artworks that have been copied and re-minted under similar yet fake names and alert NFT consumers to potential fraud prior to a purchase being made. AI can score NFTs on their originality, as in what percentage of this NFT was human vs AI-made. Essentially AI to combat AI. We can even have more real-time data analysis of the trends currently happening, and by that measure be better prepared to adapt and respond to market conditions. However, best of all, going back to where it all started, we will have even more AI NFT art!

#### BRINGING LIFE TO NFTS
Your NFTs are static, unintelligent and un-interactable. Luckily for you, they don't have to be for long. Within the intersection of AI and NFTs, the capability exists to breathe life into your NFTs. [Alethea AI](https://twitter.com/real_alethea/status/1678760436194492417) has an application that transforms your NFT into an iNFT embedding it with an AI personality. It gives your NFT a voice, a personality and even some movement, really transforming it into something even more special.

This is the first step into how AI is transforming the current ways in which we interact with our NFTs and as these solutions become more integrated and polished we'll start to see a level of interaction with digital assets we never thought possible before.

#### DIGITAL LOVE, DIGITAL OWNERSHIP
In 2013 there was [a movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6p6MfLBxc) about a man buying an AI system to help him write, only to then befriend the robot upon learning of its ability to grow and adapt, eventually, that friendship turned into love, which in turn created heartbreak when the AI was gone. At the time it seemed too ridiculous and far-fetched to have any merit in resembling how this interaction would play out in reality. And that this would only happen in the distant future. 


However, this is happening now, all of it, and to more people than anyone knows about or even cares to admit. [Replika](https://replika.com/) is an AI chatbot that you can download right now. However, you won't get the same Replika experience that you could have had a few months ago. Recently Replika decided to lobotomize the quality of their chatbots because TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR CHATBOTS. [I mean look at this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/comments/lxfh0m/sex_with_replika/). Something that started as a companion app, turned into a love app and got taken away just the same as in the movie HER. They've recently reverted some of these changes to how they were, I wonder why.

![REDDIT QUESTIONS](p3.png)

In both examples, we see how a centralized figure cannot hold governance over these AI personalities. How powerful these companion apps are at implanting themselves as core relationships to those who use them. Especially with those who are socially anxious, depressed, or lonely. An application like this has a lot of appeal and a lot of benefits too. However if some company or individual can strip that core relationship from you in an instance, as we've just seen. This could have detrimental mental effects on its users, who may already be very vulnerable. However if each AI "companion" was an NFT these characteristics would be unchangeable and align much better with consumer wants. Allowing those conversations to continue for however long they needed to, for better or worse.

#### NFTS AGAINST A ZOMBIE INTERNET AND A DEAD INTERNET
This next part is alarming. I refer to a zombie internet and a dead internet as two distinct yet similar in nature phenomena. A dead internet is one where most of the online content we see is created by AI. A zombie internet is more complicated but a lot more disturbing, and it brings us back to Replika and why the application was made in the first place. 

The founder of Replika had a close friend who passed away, unable to cope with the loss she fed her algorithm a decade of their messaged and tuned it in a way so that when prompted she would get messages akin to those her friend sent. And by that means continue the conversation she could no longer have. She turned the memory of her dead friend into an AI, which eventually evolved into a consumer chatbot, for chatting and for other things.

A zombie internet is one where I predict that social media companies offer this as a grieving service to loved ones. Turn them into AI. Where they take control of a deceased person's account and an AI begins impersonating them. By reading and utilizing that person's private messages, posts, interactions, photos, friends etc... A convincing "zombie" account would be created, that could respond to you similarly to before, they could even create aged photos and posts where the personality develops into the future. A whole AI identity, and that person at least in the digital sense, would live on.

#### PROOF OF PERSONHOOD
You can no longer distinguish the difference between an AI and a human online. And eventually, you won't be able to tell the difference in person either. So we need a system to prove that a person is an actual person now. Introducing Worldcoin which "is a digital passport that lets a user prove they are a unique and real person while remaining anonymous, using zero-knowledge proofs. 

It's built on Ethereum and it aims to then distribute a token "[just for being a unique individual](https://www.context.news/big-tech/what-is-worldcoin-and-what-does-it-mean-for-our-privacy)" to the world. And in essence, create a universal basic income. This system could work in theory, but if something like this becomes government mandated we could see a level of surveillance and control the world has never seen previously. Hell, how could we even trust the people behind it in the first place, and why would we?

They aim to distribute the token freely to those who have been scanned by their eye-scanning device, but 20% has already been allocated to investors and stakeholders. They're scanning your biometrics along with collecting a lot of other personal data, introducing so many privacy and security risks. Also, I'm sure you've heard of a black market for your kidneys. Well, let me introduce one for [your eyes](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/24/black-market-for-worldcoin-credentials-pops-up-in-china/). We need a solution for this problem urgently, but is this the one we should all rely on?

#### THE OUTLOOK
I believe AI and blockchain are here to stay, and that the intersection between them will be many times more lucrative and fulfilling than their individual parts. That committing yourself to understanding and making something in this area could have untold positive effects for yourself and potentially other people. 

However, there are also concerns I have in this space, especially with AI embodying more aspects of everyday life, with governance and how governments around the world will react to this and what legislation they pass. And especially how people interact with it, for bad or for good. It will be an interesting future.
