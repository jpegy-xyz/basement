### What is Friend.tech

Your network is your net worth. At least according to friend.tech. They're aiming to put it to the test by tokenising access to a private network of your favourite influencer.

friend.tech is a new social token platform that connects your Twitter profile to a wallet on Base chain. Users can buy tokens of other users on the platform that enable them to connect directly with that user in a semi-private chat.

To download friend.tech head to [their website](https://www.friend.tech/) on your phone and follow the prompts. Currently, an app isn't available on the Apple or Play stores. You'll also need an invite code to participate which can be [found on X](https://twitter.com/search?q=friendtech%20code&src=typed_query&f=live). After which you'll have to deposit some eth, which will be used to buy keys(tokens) of other users. Allowing you to chat with them.

### Social Tokens

Social tokens aren't a new concept. They've been tried previously many a time and failed a similar amount of times. They're similar in concept to other tokens like jrny, MVHQ or Underground. Where when you own the token you get access to the thing. The thing here is access to a direct chat with an influencer or other user.

Interestingly, friend.tech is very similar to other social token platforms such as Roll and Rally, Rally didn't perform so well in the long run, and acts as a reminder of what can go wrong in these types of platforms. Here's a chart.

It's easy to see a bad chart and blame the whole concept of social token platforms, but let's break it down into challenges and potentials.

Social token platform challenges
1. Difficulty in growth: One of the biggest obstacles facing social token platforms is their difficulty in scaling. Unlike traditional social media platforms that have millions to billions of users, social token platforms attract much smaller, niche communities. If the platform does not reach the critical mass necessary for sustainability. It will fail.
2. Higher barrier of entry: Another hurdle that these platforms face is the relatively high barrier of entry. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X are all free to access and use. Social token platforms however require a user to invest in tokens to participate fully. This financial requirement can majorly deter potential new users and limit and often cripple user growth.
3. Ponzi-like tendencies: Early adopters stand to gain a lot more than latecomers, especially when the price of influencer tokens exponentially increases with each additional token held. As well as the fact that users can own their own tokens and dump them instantly, it creates a very ponzi-like environment.

Social token platform potential
1. A more intimate community-building opportunity for influencers, to connect and interact with their most loyal fans. Creating tangible benefits for their audience, and similarly allowing fans to get close interaction with their preferred influencers.
2. Leveraging the community to be part of governance mechanisms and generally encouraging user participation through airdrops and the like, could boost the popularity of the platform, and see a newer type of social media where the user has a lot more control and influence.

### Legitimacy

With all the negatives to be said, we should also look into what's behind the platform and its legitimacy as a true social media.

friend.tech is backed by [Paradigm](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/534396-16#funding) a massive investment firm that's invested in the likes of Opensea, Blur, Coinbase and many more. So it has investment credibility. It has garnered user credibility quite quickly too, with widespread adoption by the crypto community. It has not broached much further except for the OnlyFans models.

We can see through this graph that the number of unique users is growing, however, we can't gauge how much activity each user is spending on the platform, and if the activity is realistic for a social media platform.

Lots of larger influencers are already taking full advantage of the ecosystem and leveraging their existing user base on other platforms. By interacting regularly with their key holders and offering them value, they can generate revenue for themselves through the 5% fee that they receive from each transaction.

We can also see that the number of these transactions are high, however very very volatile, with interest in friend.tech waining and growing sporadically. With recent interest booming, can we actually expect it to last? Or even grow?

### Market Opportunites

There are some market opportunities in friend.tech, however not without risk. More opportunities with less risk do exist if you have an existing social presence or fan base. As a result, even OnlyFans models have been leveraging the platform to facilitate private chats with their fans. However, this doesn't come as a surprise as they have always been the truest form of hustlers on these streets.

We'll look at some of these potential methods below.

1. friend.tech app speculation
   - You can speculate on the growth of the application by buying tokens from high-value influencers that can be used as a proxy metric for the overall platform performance. Influencers could include, Racer, Cobie, Haska etc..
2. User speculation
   - Some influnecers could be providing more value than others on the platform and as prices are highly volatile you could see an opportunity where the price of their keys are currently undervalued.
3. New user sniping
   - Be on the lookout for new users joining the platform who already have an established following. If you manage to buy their keys very quickly you can buy at a massive discount. There are [discord communities](https://discord.gg/NJY8tkNa2Z) that give you live feeds of new users joining so you can be updated in real-time. However, the reality is this technique is heavily botted, and it might be better to employ your own bot rather than gruel through the manual process.
4. Networking tool
   - friend.tech allows you to connect with some of the most prominent people in the space fairly easily.
   - you can use that to leverage your brand directly to the people you want to reach.
   - you can also gain useful insights from these closed group chats.
5. Airdrop farming
   - Max out points, more about this later.
6. Farming as a chat influencer
   - Bringing value into the chat incentivises people to buy your tokens.
   - you are then rewarded a percentage of transactions of your tokens sales, which can have a big upside for you, with less risk than trading other user keys.

friend.tech has been lucrative for some of the best traders, however, the competition is fierce and dominated by bots. However, these traders should still see some more upside from the upcoming airdrop.

Influencers seem to be generating a large amount of money for themselves too, with a lot less risk than the traders had put up.

### Airdrop

Like fly's to honey, wherever there is an airdrop there are sure to be crypto degens too. It's a large part of the attraction of friend.tech, airdrop farmers trying to grow their crops for harvest.

And it's also expected that this airdrop will be quite a substantial one. Airdrop points are distributed weekly, however, gaming points prove difficult as they change the criteria of how to get points weekly.

Although we can't guarantee the exact method that would grant the most points week by week, we can speculate on what should garner points.

These could include
- Buying and selling keys
  - weighted by key values
- App activity like messaging
  - this could also be a slight multiplier for other point metrics
- Using invite codes
  - if you don't have anyone to share them with, post them on Twitter with a burner account
- Holding keys
  - weighted by key values

These points are distributed every Friday, and in short, the below table was created by axsn who did a [solid writeup](https://twitter.com/asxn_r/status/1693280773237805400) into the potential value of the airdrop.

### Issues

friend.tech has issues. A lot of which we've seen time and time again with social token platforms. The question is will we fall into the same trap time and time again? Probably, but hopefully not if we spend time to analyse it.

Let's list some of the issues
1. friend.tech [Keys can be botted](https://twitter.com/duoxehyon/status/1694410633247420743).
2. Influnecers and friend.tech stand to gain the most
3. Influencers can stockpile their own tokens in order to artificially inflate prices only to later dump them on unsuspecting holders.
4. The value of the chat is determined by the influencer. If they don't want to add any value, they don't have to.
5. You can't determine the quality of the chat before you join. You cannot even see if it's still active or if the influencer is even involved in chatting.
6. Retail stands to lose the most, as they offer up the most risk.
7. Highly volatile, with huge spikes and troughs in the number of user transactions and activity.
8. Only a certain amount of users can hold influencer tokens before it becomes prohibitively expensive.
9. These types of platforms have been tried before and failed, which doesn't necessarily mean this will too, but the history is there, be cautious.
10. Post airdrop dump. As lots of users are only using friend.tech to farm airdrop points and not for the actual platform itself. After the airdrop is distributed we could see a massive layoff of keys a sharp decline in key prices and an opposite increase in volatility.

So clearly some major issues, but nothing worthwhile is ever without them. However, lots of the problems listed can be fixed to make the platform better, especially in regards to knowing if the chat is being actively maintained by the influencer.

Always exercise caution with these things, and do your own research. This article isn't advise or anything like that.

Take care.

### A New Competitor

Very recently an exciting new competitor to friend.tech has emerged, only this time utilising Bitcoin instead of the Base network. As it was recently launched it's untested. However, the developers are exxtremely active with the community and development is proceeding at a rapid rate. Is there a tangible benefit to using this instead of friend.tech? Not at the moment unless you want to be immersed more closely with the Bitcoin ecosystem. But I mention it now, because of it's potential to become a breakthrough product much the same way Bitcoin ordinals have. 

This is an even more risky venture than what's been discussed previously and even more caution should be taken as a result. Here's a link to a Twitter thread going over the launch of [Alpha](https://twitter.com/NewBitcoinCity/status/1703056333250113666)
